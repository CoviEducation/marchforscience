Our research program is guided by the belief that studying the intersection of basic neural processes, cognition, affective and motivational systems, and long-term behavioral outcomes is the best way to understand self-regulation and to develop novel interventions to help people be successful in their goal pursuit.","public","0","2016-10-29 15:51:30","0"
"27","6","Stanford Social Neuroscience Laboratory","stanford-social-neuroscience-laboratory","Vonnegut was right; readers (and pretty much everyone else for that matter) are mostly interested in other human beings, and especially in the contents of others? minds. This preoccupation is a good thing, because it allows us to accomplish some of life?s central tasks: understanding, communicating, coordinating and commiserating with others. At the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab, we leverage a wide array of techniques (including behavioral testing, psychophysiology, neuroimaging, and field research) to examine the cognitive bases of these social behaviors.","public","0","2017-03-08 01:58:25","0"
"32","7","DSN Lab at the University of Oregon","dsn-lab-at-the-university-of-oregon","In the Developmental Social Neuroscience Lab, we study the developmental trajectories and neural correlates of self-evaluation, perception and understanding of others, emotions, motivation, decision-making, and self-regulation.

The overarching goal of developmental social neuroscience is to understand the neural systems that support socioemotional development from childhood through adolescence into adulthood, by drawing on theories and methods from developmental and social psychology as well as cognitive neuroscience. We aim to apply this knowledge about the science of adolescent development to improve outcomes, particularly for those youth who are most at risk.","public","0","2017-04-17 17:32:23","0"

We study the dynamics of personality in social contexts. We are interested in topics like self-perception and interpersonal perception, emotion processes in social contexts, lifespan personality development, and the psychology of online societies.","public","0","2017-04-19 18:21:44","0"
"34","425","Page Lab at the Florida Museum","page-lab-at-the-florida-museum","It is impossible to accurately study the natural world without having accurate and well described species. In addition, conservation biologists and resource managers depend on accurate taxonomic information and museum collection records for prioritizing areas for protection and for making informed species-specific management policies. The Page lab predominately focuses on systematic (interrelationships between organisms) and taxonomic (naming and describing new species) research of fishes. In addition, this lab also explores ecological and behavioral phenomena in freshwater fishes and bioinformatics (analysis of complex biological data)  using natural history museum data. Dr. Page is also the lead PI on the iDigBio project with is charged with coordinating and mobilizing the national effort to digitize museum collections.","public","0","2017-04-25 19:35:19","0"

"37","447","Brain Connectivity and Cognition Laboratory","brain-connectivity-and-cognition-laboratory","Our lab is interested broadly in the relationship between brain connectivity and cognition in typical and atypical development. Within a cognitive neuroscience framework, our research examines the organization of large-scale brain networks supporting high-level cognitive processes. Current projects focus on understanding dynamic network interactions underlying cognitive flexibility in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.","public","0","2017-04-27 18:55:26","0"
"38","466","STEM: Signals and Systems","stem-signals-and-systems","We research fundamental principles of sciences (biology, physics, chemistry, ecology, sociology), technology (electronics), engineering (neuroengineering, biomedical, industrial) and mathematics.  These principles are ideally expressed in logical/mathematical/graphical symbols (i.e. graph theory, block diagrams, circuits, informatics) but also using the power of natural languages and art.  Our goal is to develop a truly integrated, unified view of our universe so we can serve all the living beings in it and improve their quality of life.","public","0","2017-04-27 23:36:11","0"
