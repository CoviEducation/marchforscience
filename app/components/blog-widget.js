magic of Science.\u201D</em></p><p>The first time I stepped in my first biochemistry lab at Kenyatta University, I was fascinated. I did not want to leave. The lab was well equipped, a rarity in rural Kenya. I still remember treasuring every second I spent in the lab. I remember wondering why throughout my earlier education, my peers and I did not have access to a modern science lab facility.&nbsp;</p><p>I grew up in a rural village in Kenya and went through local elementary and public high school. I didn\u2019t experience science in a laboratory setting until late in high school. Even then, much of the science I was exposed to was literature oriented, and only designed to allow me and the rest of the students to acquire the knowledge we needed to pass the practical exams. Science was never practical nor hands on; therefore, our curiosity was silenced. They say that every child is a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/09/little-kids-are-natural-scientists/\">natural scientist</a>, but sadly, for me and many other children, that innate scientist ability was never encouraged or nurtured. As a result, I did not see myself ever becoming a scientist.</p><p>Today, things are much the same. Many rural parts of the African continent still lack laboratory facilities to ignite the passion for science in young students. And in institutions that have science labs, the laboratories are <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110629/full/474556a.html\">unequipped</a> to carry out the fast paced 21st century science. Lack of access to science laboratory denies young students the opportunity to experience the magic and fascination of science. It also denies them the opportunity to discover how interesting, exciting and rewarding science can be. At the same time, lack of well-equipped labs limits the ability of many researchers to address society\u2019s pressing challenges.</p><p>Despite the lack of well-equipped science laboratories, and funds to support research and innovation that <a href=\"http://www.scidev.net/global/funding/opinion/scant-funding-for-research-facilities-is-hurting-africa-1.html\">hurts</a> the African continent, its leaders acknowledge that science and technology will continue to facilitate sustainable growth and development while playing a major role in solving todays pressing challenges including climate change, hunger, and lack of water, and energy. &nbsp;</p><p>On a beautiful summer day of August, 6, 2011, I finally received my doctorate degree in Entomology and became the first woman in my community to obtain a PhD degree. As I walked to collect my degree, my thoughts meandered back to my community in Kenya. I thought of the many children in there who had the potential to be a scientist like me but lacked the opportunity. That day, I told myself that I would do whatever it necessary to give the children in my community, other poor communities, and throughout Africa the opportunities to break the poverty barrier, get an education and go attain their goals, including becoming scientists.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1492132982254_26521\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n  \n\n  \t\n      <div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-overlay-hover design-layout-inline\">\n      \n        <div class=\"intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:1920.0px;\">\n          \n            <div style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%;\" class=\"image-block-wrapper   has-aspect-ratio\" data-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi&lt;/p&gt;\" >\n              <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58f027b0414fb573710ea763/1492138567077/Kikonenilab.JPG\"  alt=\"Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi\"  /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58f027b0414fb573710ea763/1492138567077/Kikonenilab.JPG\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58f027b0414fb573710ea763/1492138567077/Kikonenilab.JPG\" data-image-dimensions=\"1920x1080\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"58f027b0414fb573710ea763\" data-type=\"image\" />\n            </div>\n          \n\n          \n          <div class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p>Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi</p></div>\n          </div>\n          \n\n        </div>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1492132982254_30173\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>So when it was time to get married, I decided that instead of getting gifts, I would <a href=\"https://www.fundprovo.com/funding/when-esther-ngumbi-planned-her-wedding-her-wishes-were-for-one-present-only-to-build-a-science-lab-so-as-to-inspire-a-generation-of-scientists\">raise funds</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a47499/womans-wedding-registry-will-inspire-you-to-be-better/\">build a science laboratory</a> for my community to inspire a generation of scientists.</p><p>Increasing the number of scientific labs across the world, including the African continent, would first and foremost inspire many more young people to consider science as a career. Secondly, science labs give researchers the opportunity to develop solutions that help transform lives and spark new business opportunities in key areas such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy and education.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, many of the global challenges our world faces today including climate change, HIV/AIDS, healthcare, recurring droughts and feeding the growing population sustainably, benefit from research results spawned from science labs in universities and research institutions.</p><p>Thankfully, across Africa and around the world we are seeing more efforts to increase the number of scientific labs. <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/africa/\">IBM</a> research group, for example, recently established lab facilities in Kenya and South Africa\u2013\u2013labs that provide researchers a space to develop commercially-viable solutions in numerous key areas including agriculture and healthcare.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.nexteinstein.org/about-us/?lang=en\">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> is another initiative that has established several centers across Africa. These centers serve as a space that inspires and enables youth to shape Africa\u2019s future through STEM\u2013\u2013Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. And in South Africa, five <a href=\"http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/498/157978.html\">science centers</a> were recently launched in an effort to support hands-on science teaching and learning at schools. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1492132982254_31086\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n  \n\n  \t\n      <div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-overlay-hover design-layout-inline\">\n      \n        <div class=\"intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:1920.0px;\">\n          \n            <div style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%;\" class=\"image-block-wrapper   has-aspect-ratio\" data-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi&lt;/p&gt;\" >\n              <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58f0283444024397c4e8a2bd/1492137944118/\"  alt=\"Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi\"  /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58f0283444024397c4e8a2bd/1492137944118/\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58f0283444024397c4e8a2bd/1492137944118/\" data-image-dimensions=\"1920x1080\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"58f0283444024397c4e8a2bd\" data-type=\"image\" />\n            </div>\n          \n\n          \n          <div class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p>Photo credit: Esther Ngumbi</p></div>\n          </div>\n          \n\n        </div>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1492132982254_35253\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>For my part, I will continue to advocate for the need to build more science labs, especially in rural areas.

I have a deep and abiding respect for the amazing diversity of living organisms, their habits and their habitats. This ethic was shaped during my childhood when I was free to wander the natural environs of my hometown. I could go to those places any time of day, during any season: breathing, smelling, listening, observing, touching and tasting to discover nature\u2019s wonders. That sense of wonder has endured. It\u2019s what keeps me asking the probing questions that let me learn scientifically how species fit together to build up and sustain nature. It thus saddens\u2014sometimes even maddens\u2014me to see nature\u2019s transformation in the name of human \u201Cprogress.\u201D</p><p>But as a scientist, I must admit that these changes are also fascinating. It turns out that rapid human-caused changes present much opportunity for new scientific discoveries. They force me to see and appreciate the dynamism of nature from fundamentally new vantage points. I find that nature can be more resilient than we often give it credit for, a fact that should inspire hope for a bright, sustainable environmental future in the Anthropocene.</p><p>Changing the mindset from despair to hope requires letting go of a deeply held notion that nature exists in a fragile balance, and that humankind has a persistent habit of disrupting that balance. Nature is perpetually changeable, with or without human presence. Life\u2019s energetic pace, and the primal drive of all organisms to survive and reproduce, is what builds resilience in the face of change. We are learning how nutrients are perpetually transformed and redistributed by plant and animal species to sustain myriad ecological functions. These functions ensure that we have ample clean and fresh water, deep and fertile soils, genetic variety to produce hardy crops, the means to pollinate those crops, and the capacity to mitigate impacts of gaseous emissions, among numerous other services that humans rely on to sustain their health and livelihoods. Many species also can rapidly acclimate and even evolve within a mere span of a couple of human generations to cope with significant and rapid environmental change. Such adaptability allows many ecological systems to recover from human-caused disturbances and damages within the short time span of a human lifetime, no less.</p><p>This capacity for resilience is perhaps our most important evolutionary heritage. It is what gives hope for a sustainable future. The challenge of sustainability, then, is to engage with nature without eroding this capacity. The emerging science-based ethic of earth environmental stewardship can help on this front. It sees humans and nature entwined, where humans have obligations to one another mediated through their mutual relationships with nature.</p><p>Earth environmental stewardship strives to sustain nature\u2019s resilience by protecting the evolutionary and ecological interdependence of all living beings and the physical environment. It strives for continuous improvement of environmental performance and human wellbeing through a commitment to use nature\u2019s resources wisely and efficiently as dividends of resilient ecosystem functions. This means protecting entire ecosystems, not just their parts, and ensuring the development of sensible environmental policies and regulations to ensure that ecosystem services benefit all living beings now and in the future.</p><p>Effective earth environmental stewardship requires that we take deliberate interest in becoming scientifically informed about how our needs and wants are linked to our local environment and the larger world beyond. So on this Earth Day, it is perhaps fitting to reflect on and celebrate our amazing scientific achievements to understand the durability of nature and the wealth of opportunity it offers for a sustainable future in the Anthropocene.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491947319442_21832\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><hr /></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-col-3 span-3 float float-left\" data-aspect-ratio=\"100.7751937984496\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491947319442_35889\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n  \n\n  \t\n      <div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-hidden design-layout-inline\">\n      \n        <div class=\"intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:450.0px;\">\n          \n            <div style=\"padding-bottom:100.77519226074219%;\" class=\"image-block-wrapper   has-aspect-ratio\" data-description=\"\" >\n              <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58ed569617bffc2c5146283d/1491949296715/\"  /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58ed569617bffc2c5146283d/1491949296715/\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58ed569617bffc2c5146283d/1491949296715/\" data-image-dimensions=\"450x600\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.4645669291338583,0.378698224852071\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"58ed569617bffc2c5146283d\" data-type=\"image\" />\n            </div>\n          \n\n          \n\n        </div>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491947319442_21894\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p><em>Oswald J.

When marching, do not wear a university sweatshirt, work-issued lab coat, etc.</p></li><li><p>Maintain distinct personal and professional email accounts. Even discussions with work colleagues about the March should take place via private email. Be professional whenever you are using email; remember that any email can be forwarded. Check out our blog post on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://climatesciencedefensefund.org/2017/03/10/the-importance-of-good-email-practice/\">The Importance of Good E-Mail Practice</a></strong>.</p></li><li><p>Engage in organizations or discussion about the March with after work-hours.</p></li><li>If you wish to publicize your participation or opinions about the March, it is best not to provide your work affiliation. Publicizing your participation includes taking an interview with a journalist (remember that <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.senseaboutscienceusa.org/guides-for-scientists/\">you\u2019re on record!</a></strong>), signing a petition, writing a blog post, or posting on social media. If you choose to state your position, clarify that it is for identification purposes only; you are not speaking on behalf of your institution.</li></ul><h3>\u00A0</h3><h3><strong>Know Your Employer\u2019s Stance </strong></h3><p>We urge you to keep your participation separate from your work; still, you should go in knowing all the facts (you\u2019re a scientist, after all!).</p><ul><li><p>Check out whether your institution or employer is supporting the March.&nbsp;<em>Science </em>is <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/will-they-or-won-t-they-what-science-groups-are-saying-about-joining-march-science\">collecting statements about the March from various organizations</a></strong>, but the best approach is to directly ask your employer.</p></li><li>Review your employee handbook or speak to HR about the expectations or rules of your institution. For example, are you allowed to speak out on behalf of, against, or simply in opposition to your institution on specific issues? Are you allowed to speak about the March or other protests while at work?</li></ul><h3>\u00A0</h3><h3><strong>Determine Whether You (and Your Emails) Are Subject to Open Records Laws </strong></h3><p>Open record laws allow members of the public to request information from public employees, which can include work records and emails. If you are a federal employee, or work at a state university, you are usually considered a public employee, and may be subject to the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or state open records laws. Recall that even at private institutions, federal grants may subject you to FOIA.

Not something abstract, which only scientists care about\u200A\u2014\u200Alike levels of research funding, or pressures on scientists. This needs to be something <em>everyone </em>can appreciate.</p><p>Do we want to be the America that embraces science to advance our health, safety, and prosperity, making us the leader of the world?</p><p>Or do want America to mimic failed regimes of the past, where knowledge and science were suppressed to benefit a few, or to funnel more profits into dying industries?</p><p><strong>Give us a vision of America that embraces science.</strong>This is the America that defeated fascism. It won the cold war. It landed on the moon. It cured polio. It is the beacon of knowledge and hope for the world.</p><p>We need more Americans to identify with this vision and to <em>believe</em>&nbsp;in it. Only then can we inspire them to advocate for it too.</p><h3>\u00A0</h3><h3>Engage in political conversations.&nbsp;</h3><p>Traditionally, scientists have steered clear of the political fray. But if the past months have taught us anything, it\u2019s that science is <em>intimately</em>&nbsp;connected to politics. It always has been. After all, politics is how we are supposed to solve problems in a democratic society, and science is crucial to nearly <em>everything</em>&nbsp;we do\u200A\u2014\u200Aour economy, our health, our security, our future. You <em>cannot</em>&nbsp;isolate science from politics, or politics from science. To try is folly.</p><p>That is why scientists shouldn\u2019t shy away from engaging in political conversations. Now more than ever,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/science/to-my-fellow-climate-scientists-be-human-be-brave-tell-the-truth-20170207\">it is</a>&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://the-macroscope.org/science-communication-as-a-moral-imperative-14188eb7d797#.fdmeks42o\"><em>necessary</em>&nbsp;to be in them</a>. We can start by demonstrating the critical role that science plays in people\u2019s lives. What are the <em>tangible</em>&nbsp;benefits of science to society, and why does investing in science benefit us?</p><p>Science advocates should also pose important political questions, taking a more direct part in shaping the national discourse. For example, when \u201Cskeptics\u201D try to undermine the validity of climate science, let\u2019s explore their underlying motives, rather than simply defending the data.</p><p>Of course, scientists should always be professional, prudent, and stick to their areas of expertise. Also, scientists should avoid partisanship. But the discourse of any modern nation depends on science. If scientists don\u2019t lend their expertise to our broader conversations, who will?</p><h3>\u00A0</h3><h3>Don\u2019t fall into the \u201CCulture War\u201D trap.</h3><p>The War on Science is partly fueled by deepening divisions over class, education, religion, and urban vs. rural lifestyles. This is all part of the larger Culture War we see in the country today, and its flames are being fanned by politicians and media icons who are trying to divide us.</p><p><strong><em>Don\u2019t fall for it.</em></strong></p><p>To focus on these false divisions is to get bogged down in fights over things like creationism versus evolution, faith versus science, and our different views about our place in the universe.</p><p>Rather than magnifying these existential differences, science supporters would be wise to find common ground with people of faith. Scientists have more in common with value-driven communities than most people realize. We all search for meaning, and share a deeply-held fascination with the natural world. In this way, science and religion are allies. Texas Tech professor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://katharinehayhoe.com/wp2016/\">Katharine Hayhoe</a>&nbsp;is a good example of someone who is bridging these worlds, creating a constructive dialogue.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491795376681_98082\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n  \n\n  \t\n      <div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-overlay-hover design-layout-inline\">\n      \n        <div class=\"intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:2000.0px;\">\n          \n            <div style=\"padding-bottom:36.64999771118164%;\" class=\"image-block-wrapper   has-aspect-ratio\" data-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Northport, Maine.

They don\u2019t need to <em>discredit</em>&nbsp;well-founded scientific ideas, like climate change, they just need to create confusion and doubt. This is a well-known tactic, thoroughly documented in the book \u201C<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/\">Merchants of Doubt</a>.\"</p><p>At his confirmation hearings, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt showed us the language of this approach. Manmade climate change, he says, is \u201C<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/01/epa-scott-pruitt-science\">subject to continuing debate</a>.\u201D Methane is released by fracking, but he\u2019s \u201C<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/tracker-we-re-letting-you-know-when-trump-s-cabinet-nominees-talk-about-science-and\">not deeply concerned</a>.\u201D And lead poisoning is \u201C<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/epa-nominee-scott-pruitt-lead-poisoning/\">not something [he has] looked into</a>.\u201D</p><p>This subtle attack on scientific ideas, intended to sow doubt and confusion, has proven to be a reliable method for manipulating public perception, derailing research, censoring data, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38746608\">stalling political action</a>.</p><h3>\u00A0</h3><h3>Balance facts with stories.</h3><p>Facts alone are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds\">not enough</a>&nbsp;to win debates, let alone hearts and minds. Research shows that more knowledge can often <em>deepen</em>&nbsp;the divide between people on polarizing issues. \u201CIndividuals subconsciously resist factual information that threatens their defining values,\u201D a recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid\">study</a>&nbsp;points out.</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<em>stories</em>&nbsp;help build bridges of mutual understanding. They break down barriers and preconceived ideas, promoting empathy, trust, inspiration, and hope.</p><p>Not all scientists are great storytellers, but most scientists have great stories to tell. It often helps for people to understand the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://the-macroscope.org/science-a-deathbed-promise-and-a-mothers-gift-36cc36ca1a9c#.e8hrldju4\">story</a>&nbsp;behind the science. This can go a long way toward building trust, helping hard facts get through.</p><h3>\u00A0</h3><h3>Stand up.</h3><p>Finally, let\u2019s not sugar coat the significance of this war. Powerful interests, with huge profits at stake, have tried to undermine America\u2019s scientists for decades. They\u2019ve <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-is-what-the-coming-attack-on-climate-science-could-look-like/2016/12/16/e015cc24-bd8c-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.6aa3b3326a73\">intimidated</a>&nbsp;scientists. They\u2019ve ridiculed them. (Occasionally, incited zealots have even threatened to kill them.) They put up so-called \u201Cexperts\u201D who try to dispute overwhelming evidence, yet offering none of their own, to deliberately sow confusion in the public.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/index.html\">Merchants of Doubt</a>&nbsp;have an effective strategy, but only if we allow it. It\u2019s time to call this out. The short-term gains of a few corporations must no longer rise above our national interests, our economic competitiveness, and most importantly, our safety, health, and wellbeing.</p><p>America has a choice to make. A choice between advancing civilization or bringing it down. Now we must choose which side we are on.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491795376681_119573\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n  \n\n  \t\n      <div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-overlay-hover design-layout-inline\">\n      \n        <div class=\"intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:2500.0px;\">\n          \n            <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Moon_from_space#/media/File:Hovering_on_the_Horizon_-_NASA_Earth_Observatory.jpg\" >\n          \n            <div style=\"padding-bottom:43.439998626708984%;\" class=\"image-block-wrapper   has-aspect-ratio\" data-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Image by NASA's Earth Observatory, &quot;Hovering on the Horizon.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\" >\n              <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58eb030ee6f2e1dfce589823/1491797137565/\"  alt=\"Image by NASA's Earth Observatory, &quot;Hovering on the Horizon.&quot;\u00A0\"  /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Image by NASA's Earth Observatory, &quot;Hovering on the Horizon.&quot;\u00A0\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58eb030ee6f2e1dfce589823/1491797137565/\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58904d98197aea6ab40aca82/t/58eb030ee6f2e1dfce589823/1491797137565/\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1086\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"58eb030ee6f2e1dfce589823\" data-type=\"image\" />\n            </div>\n          \n            </a>\n          \n\n          \n          <div class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p>Image by NASA's Earth Observatory, \"Hovering on the Horizon.\"&nbsp;</p></div>\n          </div>\n          \n\n        </div>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491786032084_172361\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><hr /></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1491786032084_174342\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.calacademy.org/staff-member/jonathan-foley-phd\"><em>Jonathan Foley</em></a><em>&nbsp;(@GlobalEcoGuy) is a world-leading environmental scientist and the executive director of the California Academy of Sciences.
